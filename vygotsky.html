    <p class="mb-4">
      Lev Vygotsky emphasized the importance of social interaction in the learning process. According to him, learning is a collaborative process that happens best with the guidance of a more capable peer or teacher. The concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) describes the gap between what a learner can do alone and what they can achieve with support.

      Scaffolding is another key concept in Vygotsky's theory. It refers to providing temporary support to help students accomplish tasks until they can perform independently.

    <p class="mb-4">
      Jean Piaget believed children actively construct knowledge through interaction with their environment. He introduced concepts like assimilation and accommodation to explain how children adapt their mental models based on new experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Piaget also described stages of cognitive development, suggesting that children move through sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational stages as they grow and learn.
